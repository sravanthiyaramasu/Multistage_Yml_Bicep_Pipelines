🛠 Technologies Used
Bicep → Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Azure resource deployment
Azure DevOps Pipelines → CI/CD automation using YAML
GitHub → Version control and collaboration
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) → Resource provisioning
Terraform (Optional) → Alternative to Bicep for IaC

📌 Bicep Templates
The Bicep files define infrastructure components such as:

Storage Accounts
Web Apps
SQL Databases
Key Vaults

🔄 Multi-Stage YAML Pipelines
The YAML pipelines automate the process of:

Build Stage → Validate and lint Bicep files.
Test Stage → Run pre-deployment checks.
Deploy Stage → Deploy resources to Azure using Bicep.
Post-Deployment Validation → Verify deployment success.

🔹 Run the YAML Pipeline in Azure DevOps
Navigate to Azure DevOps > Pipelines.
Create a new pipeline and select "GitHub" as the source.
Choose the multistage-deployment.yaml file.
Click "Run" to trigger the pipeline.

🎯 Why This Project?
Demonstrates real-world experience with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD pipelines.
